# **Agar plating for *Synechococcus***

In this protocol, we treat 0.35 and 0.28% LMA as synonyms since during the preparation, there are two steps of dilution. There is the initial LMA dilution of 0.35% and a subsequent dilution during the plate inoculation to the final concentration of 0.28% LMA. Given that we are looking to grow the bacteria in agarose, we aim to use mid-concentrated cultures. The cultures we used were WT5.3 and M5.3, both with concentrations of 7E+06. his protocol is based on [Brahamsha (1996)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.62.5.1747-1751.1996)

1. Prepare the ingredients.

| Qty   | Concept                    |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| 12    | 6mm Petri dishes           |
| 2     | Pipette 5ml                |
| 2     | Pipette 10ml               |
| 1     | 250 ml flask               |
| 2     | 50ml falcon                |
| 0.35g | LMA (low melting  agarose) |
| 25 µl | Kanamycin                  |
| 200ml | ASW                        |
| 12    | Small parafilm  strips     |
| 1     | WT culture                 |
| 1     | MUT culture                |

2. Preheat the warm bath to 40°C. 

3. Take an aliquot of the ASW medium. *I took 250 mL in a clean, autoclaved flask.*

4. Pour 100 mL of ASW into a clean flask (**glass Erlenmeyer**) and add 0.35g of LMA. Use the heater/mixer to do it. Heat the plate at 100°C and the stirrer until the mix is crystal clear.

5. Make the serial dilutions of the cultures. Take 2 ml of Eppendorf and label with 10E+06, 10E+05, 10E+04, 10E+03, 10E+02, and 10E+01. Take 1800 µl of ASW and put it in all Eppendorf tubes except the 10E+06. Put 2 mL of the concentrated medium in the 10E+06 Eppendorf. 

6. Before diluting, ensure that the cultures are mixed in the Eppendorf. Then, take 200 µl from the first (concentrated) Eppendorf and place it into the next dilution, and so on until the 10E+01 Eppendorf. Do the same with the MUT cultures.

7. Label the Petri dishes with color coding and initial concentration. 

   ​	*This time, we used green labels for wt and orange labels for mut. In every label, we wrote the initial concentration.*

8. Once the mix of ASW and LMA     is done, put it into a hot bath at 40°C and leave it there until you need it.

9.  When the Petri dishes are ready for plating, take them close to the warm bath. With a 10ml  pipette and an electrical gun, **pour 5.2ml of the mixed agar** into the Petri dish, while another person pours **1.3ml of the corresponding Eppendorf**, accordingly. 

   ​	***Important!** When plating, start with the most concentrated dilution and so on.*

10. Seal the plates with parafilm and cautiously place them on a bench. Let them cool for a couple of hours, then transfer them to the incubator.

We should see results in the following four weeks.
